# Lecture High Performance Computing 1
Lecture description: This lecture provides an introduction to cache optimizations, parallel computer architetures and standard programming interfaces for parallel numerical algorithms. We focus on few numerical algorithms like dense matrix matrix multiplications and LU decompositions which allow us to approach step by step the theoretical peak perfomance. 

In this lecture there will be two exercise sessions per week and 9 Quizzes. Reaching atleast 50 percents of the available points in the quizzes is necessary to be permitted to take the exam. The exercises in the quizzes are based on the exerises of the exercise sessions. 

In some sessions there will not only be a exercise folder but also a lecture folder. In the lecture folder there is some code which were directly taught in the lecuture.
